# Siamese-RPN   PyTorch implementation

This is my implementation for Siamese Region Proposal Network with PyTorch.


Python version: 3.6 (3.5 or 3.4 may be also okay even though I did not try)

Pytorch version: 0.4.0 or higher


NOET:
This project is not the final version. I will add some useful comments in the near future.
